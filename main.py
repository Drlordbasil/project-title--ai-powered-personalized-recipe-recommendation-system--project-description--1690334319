Apologies for the confusion. Without the actual code, I won't be able to provide specific optimizations. However, here are some general tips to optimize Python code:

1. Use built-in functions: Python provides a rich library of built-in functions. Utilize them whenever possible, as they are generally optimized for performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: Eliminate redundant calculations or computations that can be precomputed outside of loops.

3. Use generators or list comprehensions instead of loops: Generators or list comprehensions can often be more efficient than traditional loops, especially when dealing with large datasets.

4. Utilize appropriate data structures: Choose the right data structure for your task. For example, use sets for membership testing and dictionaries for efficient key-value lookups.

5. Profile your code: Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks in your code. This will help you identify specific areas that need optimization.

Please provide the code you would like me to optimize, and I'll be happy to help you further.
